## Abstract
This paper is concerned with the ubiquitous inverse problem of recovering an
unknown function $u$ from finitely many measurements 
possibly affected by noise. In recent years, inversion methods based
on _linear_ approximation spaces were introduced with certified recovery bounds. 
It is however known that linear spaces become ineffective 
for approximating simple and relevant families of functions, such as piecewise smooth 
functions that typically occur in hyperbolic PDEs (shocks) or images (edges).
For such families, _nonlinear_ spaces are known to significantly improve
the approximation performance. The first contribution of this paper is to provide with certified recovery 
bounds for inversion procedures based on nonlinear approximation spaces. The second contribution 
is the application of this framework
to the recovery of general bidimensional shapes from cell-average data. 
We also discuss how the application of our results to $n$-term approximation relates to classical results in compressed sensing.
